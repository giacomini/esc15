  - have a `.markdown` extension
  - Start with a YAML header like:

        ---
        title: Title of the exercise
        layout: main
        ---

- Modify the document structure `menu` in _config.yml to point

  the directory containing your file. `label` is the name which will
  appear in the menu on the left.
