title: School exercise environment
layout: main
---

The goal of this step is for you to get confident with the ESC working
environment and check that everything is correctly set up for the
school exercises.

If something doesn't work as expected, please ask one of the
organizers.

## Wi-Fi access

Make sure you are using the INFN-Captive WiFi or eduroam networks and
not the CEUB WiFi network. Only the INFN-Captive or eduroam networks
will allow to connect to the ESC computers.

## SSH access to school computers

You have been assigned a personal account, with a username of the form
studentNM, where NM is a number between 01 and 30. In the following,
when you see studentNM, replace it with your personal account. You
should also have received the corresponding password.

Similarly you have been assigned a computer, named esc-XY, where XY is
a number between 01 and 60. In the following, when you see esc-XY,
replace it with the name of the host assigned to you.

To log on esc-XY you have to first log into a gateway server, named
esc-gw.pd.infn.it, with the username and password of studentNM.

	[myself@mylaptop ~]$ ssh -X studentNM@esc-gw.pd.infn.it

The `-X` option forwards the X11 display.

From there you can log into esc-XY in a password-less way, thanks to
an SSH key already generated for you and available in the `.ssh`
directory (files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`).

	[studentNM@esc-gw ~]$ ssh -X esc-XY

If you want you can do it in one step.

	[myself@mylaptop ~]$ $ ssh -tX studentNM@esc-gw.pd.infn.it ssh -X esc-XY

Your shell is [`bash`](http://www.gnu.org/s/bash).

Your home directory is shared between esc-gw and esc-XY, but
please don't use esc-gw but to log into esc-XY.

<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The student computers will be uninstalled on Friday
evening and all data on them will be destroyed. Please make sure you make
a copy of everything valuable by the end of the Friday session!

## School material

All the school material is included in a git repository. Get it using:

	git clone https://github.com/infn-esc/esc15.git

## Testing the environment

1. Log into esc-XY.

2. Check the following commands and the respective outputs.

		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ c++ -dumpversion
		5.2.0
		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ valgrind --version
		valgrind-3.10.0
		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ igprof -h
		igprof [options] program [options]
		
		Options to igprof:
		-h, --help                  	this help message
		...
		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ which igprof-navigator
		/usr/bin/igprof-navigator

3. Create a web area where you will put output from some exercises:

		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ mkdir -p ~/public_html/cgi-bin/data
		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ cp $(which igprof-navigator) ~/public_html/cgi-bin/igprof-navigator.py
		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ echo "<html><body><a href='cgi-bin/igprof-navigator.py'>My" \
		> "igprof reports</a></body></html>" > ~/public_html/index.html
		[studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ chmod 755 ~/public_html/cgi-bin

4. View `http://131.154.193.33/~studentNM/` in your web browser; you
   should see the basic page you created above. Click on the link to
   profiles, it should produce some output -- for now it will in fact
   display an error message due to lack of profiles.

## Editing source code

### Editing locally

On esc-XY you can find several editors available, such as vim, emacs,
gedit, nano. If the X display is available, graphical editors
will open a window on your laptop; the network latency however may not
be good enough to give you a fine experience.

### Editing remotely

Alternatively you could edit the source code for the exercises on your
laptop, synchronizing the files with esc-XY. Some options are
presented below.

First of all you should simplify your use of SSH to connect to ESC
resources.

If you run Linux, you could for example copy the SSH credentials
available on esc-gw onto your laptop and configure SSH to use them
when logging into esc-gw.

	[me@mylaptop ~]$ mkdir esc_ssh
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ scp studentNM@esc-gw.pd.infn.it:.ssh/id_rsa esc_ssh
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ scp studentNM@esc-gw.pd.infn.it:.ssh/id_rsa.pub esc_ssh
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ chmod 600 esc_ssh/id_rsa
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ cat >> .ssh/config <<EOF
	Host esc-gw
	HostName esc-gw.pd.infn.it
	User studentNM
	IdentityFile ~/esc_ssh/id_rsa
	EOF
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ ssh esc-gw
	Last login: ...
	[studentNM@esc-gw ~]$ 

### Using scp

You can copy files remotely using scp, in both directions.

	[me@mylaptop ~]$ scp exercise.cc @esc-gw:
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ scp @esc-gw:exercise2.cc .

### Using sshfs

You can mount your ESC home directory on your laptop via sshfs.

	[me@mylaptop ~]$ mkdir esc_workspace
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ sshfs esc-gw: esc_workspace

### Using rsync

You can synchronize your local workspace with the one you keep on the
ESC system using [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/). The synchronization
can work in both directions, so you can use it for example to save all
your work on your laptop at the end of the week.

To synchronize the remote workspace on the ESC system with your
locally-modified one you can do:
	
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ mkdir esc_workspace
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ vi esc_workspace/exercise.cc
	[me@mylaptop ~]$ rsync -av -e ssh esc_workspace esc-gw:

Similarly, if you make modifications to the remote ESC workspace you
can synchronize your local one:

	[me@mylaptop ~]$ rsync -av -e ssh esc-gw:esc_workspace .

Please refer to the rsync manual to fully understand the meaning of
the different options, so to avoid mistakes that could cause loss of
data.
